This package provides Mu2eFilename and Mu2eDSName Perl packages for
parsing and manipulating Mu2e file and dataset names.  See
https://mu2ewiki.fnal.gov/wiki/FileNames for file naming
conventions.

This package also provides authoritative definitions of standard
absolute pathnames for tape, persistent disk, and scratch based Mu2e
dataset files.  Absolute pathnames can be obtained through the
Mu2eFilename module.  The mu2eabsname_tape, mu2eabsname_disk, and
mu2eabsname_scratch utilities provide command line access to the
functionality.
